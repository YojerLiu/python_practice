1. Read [README.md](./README.md) and practice each step described in the document.

2. Declare 3 different string variables named `var1`, `var2`, `var3` respectively, while the content of these variables should be `'Happy'`, `'New'`, `'Year!'` correspondingly. Use the operator `+` to concatenate these variables to get a new string variable named `var4`. Print the content of `var4` in the terminal, which will be like:
```
HappyNewYear!
```

3. Consider the sentence below:

   > Becoming an expert won’t happen overnight, but with a little patience, you’ll get there.

Use two different methods to print the sentence above, and the print result will be like:
```
Becoming an expert won’t happen overnight, 
but with a little patience, 
you’ll get there.
```
Hint: 1. Use the feature of `print()`. 2. Use `'\n'`.
